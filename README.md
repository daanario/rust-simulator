# rust-simulator
Simple 2D simulator project for learning about Rust

## Dependencies
GTK 4.x

Rust 1.87+

## Clone and Compile (Linux only for now)
```
git clone https://github.com/daanario/rust-simulator && cd rust-simulator
```
```
cargo build --release
```

First compilation takes around 10 minutes on my machine, but subsequent builds should be faster due to incremental compilation.
